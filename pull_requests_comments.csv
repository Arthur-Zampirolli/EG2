265712,> It's not clear how often this will happen. Also confirmations can get deserialized after reloading a window and that might alert when the window is starting up?  Yes you are right. I have added a mechanism so that we only alert if 15 seconds have elapsed since a reload.

265705,@copilot would this be a simpler fix if you just use IChatWidgetService to check whether it's open in a chat widget and if so no-op?
265705,> @copilot would this be a simpler fix if you just use IChatWidgetService to check whether it's open in a chat widget and if so no-op?  You're absolutely right! I've implemented the simpler fix using `IChatWidgetService.getWidgetBySessionId()` to check if the session is already open in a chat widget and if so the action performs a no-op. This is much cleaner than my original approach of finding and focusing existing editors.  The new implementation is significantly simpler (193 lines removed 111 added) and more aligned with VS Code's service-oriented architecture. Thanks for the excellent suggestion!

265693,Could someone please assign the PR author to this?
265655,Looks like it's waiting for a review from literally all code owners.
265655,Yeah it really is. That's crazy
265655,OK I won't notify you again about this release but will get in touch when a new version is available. If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major minor or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.  If you change your mind just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.
265623,Hey sorry for the messy comments before (Removed; also iterated on my patch) but now i properly made a PR to your patch branch with my suggested changes for your work in progress enhancing security design of this PR.  See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/265693 which seeks to commit to the branch https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/ben/robust-wildcat which would show up in here if you'd approve it. Feel free to make maintainer edits or be selective in what you pick.  @bpasero
265600,@microsoft-github-policy-service agree
265600,I just reviewed this PR before: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/262959 What does your PR do differently? Thanks!
265600,"@hediet For that specific issue there's not much difference. However I added a filter to only check strings that have a length greater than 0. this avoids issues with FOO__BAR where the split function might split this into [FOO """""""" BAR]. That being said this seems to be already working properly but I just felt like it's better coding practice if I have that check in the code."

265537,I'll be happy for all these `*2` things to go away! Bump the api version on some proposal so that we don't run an extension version that still expects to have types with that name at runtime. Hard to do when a proposal is being deleted so you can just bump the `vscode.proposed.chatParticipantPrivate.d.ts` version to break compatibility
